# DTSC-580: Data Manipulation
## Assignment: Survivor

### Name: Kurtis Crowe

## Overview

This Python project serves as an assignment in the DTSC-580 course, focusing on data manipulation techniques. The assignment, titled "Survivor," requires students to apply their acquired skills to manipulate provided data related to the TV show Survivor. For those unfamiliar with the show, a brief overview can be found in this explanatory clip: [Survivor Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1-hTpG_krk)

It's imperative to name the notebook 'survivor' when submitting to CodeGrade for proper automatic grading.

## Data

The Survivor data originates from an R package by Daniel Oehm. Although Daniel has made the data available as an Excel file through his article on [gradientdescending.com](http://gradientdescending.com/survivor-data-from-the-tv-series-in-r/), students are required to use the file provided on our Brightspace page to ensure compatibility with CodeGrade's expectations. Additionally, we have corrected some errors in the file, necessitating the use of the provided data.

Before delving into the assignment questions, students should read the article linked above, which provides essential insights into the data. Furthermore, a data dictionary within the file elucidates the column definitions, aiding comprehension. Familiarizing oneself with the various spreadsheets and column names is crucial for successful completion of this assignment.

For those unacquainted with the show, here are some key points:
- Survivor is a reality TV show that premiered on May 31, 2000, and is currently ongoing.
- Contestants are divided into teams and compete in challenges for rewards and tribal immunity.
- Losing teams face elimination at tribal council, where a member is voted out.
- After a certain point, individual immunity becomes pivotal, safeguarding contestants from elimination.
- Hidden immunity idols add strategic complexity, nullifying votes against their wielder.
- Towards the end, eliminated contestants form the jury, ultimately deciding the winner, known as the Sole Survivor.

A crucial distinction:
- Tribal Council votes (Vote History spreadsheet) lead to eliminations.
- Jury Votes (Jury Votes spreadsheet) determine the winner, the Sole Survivor.

## Note

<u>Show Work</u>

It's imperative to demonstrate the steps taken to arrive at solutions. Submissions undergo manual spot checks to ensure integrity and discourage hardcoded answers. Failure to demonstrate the thought process can result in a lower grade.

For example, when identifying the contestant with the most tribal votes, display your work and code as follows:
